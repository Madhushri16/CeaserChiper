# CeaserChiper
Caesar's chiper is a ancient technic of encryption and decryption. I just remaster that technic with passkey like a randsomware. By using this system, you can do encryption and decryption of caeser's chiper messages...


The yellow color are noted as the plain text.....

The pink color are noted as shift number for the encryption and decryption, remainder the shift must be same in encryption and decryption.....

The orange color are noted as encrypted text......

The blue color are noted as passkey more like a password. It is the important thing in decryption. The passkey is created randomly in every single time you run this code.
